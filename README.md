# HoneyHonk-2.7B-Chatbot
Powered by GPT-NEO 2.7B, possibly our last version before HoneyHonk VU comes out.

HoneyHonk 2.7B is the last in the B models before HoneyHonk VU comes out. it is powered by GPT-NEO 2.7B, a language model kind of better than the 1.3B.
(just a spoiler: HoneyHonk VU will be an image generator, and HoneyHonk J will be another chatbot. we're hoping to combine those 2 together soon.)

Requirements:

Something like 10 gb of disk space (prefferably)

Python 3.8 or higher

PyTorch

Transformers

(you will install PyTorch and Transformers later in this guide)

Installation Instructions:

1. Download the HoneyHonk27b.py file
2. install the required dependencies:
   
        pip install transformers torch
   
4. open the terminal (or cmd) and paste the following command in:
   
        python HoneyHonk27b.py
   
7. Chat with HoneyHonk (just dont misuse the privacy)

Troubleshooting tips:

HoneyHonk slow or crashing? 

This model is huge, like, massive (great, now we're gonna get a buncha brainrotted kids saying "wanna know what else is massive?" and spamming lowtaperfade memes) so it might be slow on lower end hardware but you should be able to do it cuz if they can send a man to the moon with 2 kilobytes of RAM we can develop and test AI with 4 GIGABYTES of RAM. so suck it up and RUN IT.

Python cant find HoneyHonk27b.py? 

try pasting your file address in:

        python C:\users\yourusername\Downloads\HoneyHonk27b.py

(obviously if its a different address past that in)

and that should be it, message us at GooseIndustriesOfficial@outlook.com if you encounter anymore issues, or just want us to cook something up for you.
